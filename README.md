    Problem Statement

Predicting Survival in the Titanic Data Set We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic data set from Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic passengers and can be used to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

I have used only Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp (Siblings aboard), Parch (Parents/children aboard), and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived.
